## Summary Steps

For the following:

"Member and "Contributor" refer to the GSF member looking to make a feature contribution.
"Chair" refers to the Chair, Co-Chair or other accountable authority within GSF.

1. Submit a Public Issue using the Issue Template
2. The Issue will be looked at by a Chair and approved.
3. The Contributor is assigned an "Approved Reviewer" who will help shepherd the feature into the GSF Repository
4. Fork `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev` into a member repository, `member/carbon-aware-sdk/dev`
5. Open a Draft PR from `member/dev` into `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev` using the PR Template
6. Set up the Auto-PR Bot to keep the fork up-to-date with the latest version of `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev`
7. Once development is over, the Approved Reviewer pushes the PR into the "Ready for Review" state
8. If the Chair accepts the PR, it merges into `GSF/carbon-aware-sdk/dev`
